web app to train your accuracy and clicking speed

This is a webapp that you can use to Train your aim and compete with friends for scores. 

This is made fully with React and currently no Backend

Feel free to make videos or stream anything about this without having to reach out. 

If you would like to work with me on this to improve it, please reach out

This is only a test project that will later be re written in Javascript

This was done entirely by me as of now

This is NOT open source
