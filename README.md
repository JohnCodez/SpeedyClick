Speedy click is a temporary name while the project is in Developement!

You can test play it at https://speedy-click.netlify.app/ or by downloading the code and manually running it.
If the above link is not working, the site is most likely down for maintainance. This will be updated if the link changes.

The game is entirely built in the frontend folder.
This uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS

The Leaderboard and account systems will be built in the backend folder.
This uses custom rails API's 

Everything in here is made by me!<br><br>
